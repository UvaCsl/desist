abstract="To popularise in silico trials for development of new medical devices, drugs, or treatment procedures, we present the modelling framework des-ist (Discrete Event Simulation framework for In Silico Trials). This framework supports discrete event-based simulations. Here, events are collected in an acyclic, directed graph, where each node corresponds to a component of the overall in silico trial. A simple API and data layout are proposed to easily couple numerous simulations by means of containerised environments, i.e. Docker and Singularity. An example in silico trial is highlighted studying treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as considered in the INSIST project.",
